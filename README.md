# Filmyte

Filmyte is a web application for discovering your movies and TV shows.

The web client for Filmyte interacts with [Filmyte web server](https://github.com/nsrecc/filmyte-server) to deliver user requests with a pleasing user experience and interface.

## Installation

### Setup

Clone or download this repository.

Install the required dependencies: `npm install`.

### Usage

Run the client for development environment: `npm run dev`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the Filmyte web client.

### Testing

Ensure that `.babelrc` file exists at root directory with the required `"next/babel"` preset for Next.js and defined plugins array for Jest to parse the files.

Configure the `jest.config.js` file to only run test files with certain name scheme `*.test.{js,jsx}`, and to collect coverage from certain files.

Provide `cross-fetch` to `HttpLink`'s constructor while creating `ApolloClient` to ensure that `fetch` is present in the runtime environment for testing.

Run the Jest test framework: `npm test`.

Coverage results are placed in the `/coverage` folder at the root directory.
